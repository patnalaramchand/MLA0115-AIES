# DFS
# AIM:
 To Write the python program to implement DFS.
# PROGRAM::

    class Graph:
        def __init__(self):
            self.graph = {}

        def add_edge(self, u, v):
            if u not in self.graph:
              self.graph[u] = []
            if v not in self.graph:
              self.graph[v] = []
        self.graph[u].append(v)
        self.graph[v].append(u)

    def dfs(self, start, visited=None):
        if visited is None:
            visited = set()
        
        visited.add(start)
        print(start, end=" ")

        for neighbor in self.graph[start]:
            if neighbor not in visited:
                self.dfs(neighbor, visited)

    graph = Graph()
    graph.add_edge(0, 1)
    graph.add_edge(0, 2)
    graph.add_edge(1, 3)
    graph.add_edge(1, 4)
    graph.add_edge(2, 5)
    graph.add_edge(2, 6)

    print("DFS traversal starting from node 0:")
    graph.dfs(0)

# OUTPUT::

![DFS](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/36564684-84da-41dc-a95d-ecb780210892)

# RESULT::
THE PYTHON PROGRAM TO PERFORM DFS EXECUTED SUCCESSFULLY
